Learning GitHub.

I have started an online web developers bootcamp and also a data science course. GitHub is esential 
for both. Quite overwhelming to get all this information just to set up for the courses! But I am 
getting there!
Planning on making some web crawlers to find patterns on people's choices in various fields. 
Accessing APIs etc.
